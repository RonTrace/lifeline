# ADR-001: Initial Architecture Design

## Date
2025-02-02

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project needed a VS Code extension that would provide seamless integration between Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant and OpenAI's API. The key requirements were:
- Allow Cascade to call a `lifeLine()` function to interact with OpenAI
- Support file-based interaction through a `_lifeline` directory
- Maintain security of API keys
- Provide both programmatic and UI-based access

## Decision
We decided to:
1. Create a VS Code extension using TypeScript
2. Implement a dual-mode architecture:
   - Direct function calls via `lifeLine()`
   - File system watcher for markdown files in `_lifeline` directory
3. Use VS Code's built-in settings for API key management
4. Implement clipboard integration for responses
5. Support both command palette and programmatic access

## Technical Implementation
- Main extension entry point: `src/extension.ts`
- API service layer: `src/lifeLineService.ts`
- Configuration through VS Code settings
- File system watcher for `_lifeline` directory
- Clipboard integration for responses

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clean separation of concerns between extension and API service
- Secure API key management through VS Code settings
- Multiple access methods (function, files, command palette)
- Automatic response handling and clipboard integration

### Negative
- Additional complexity from supporting multiple access methods
- Need to maintain both file-based and function-based interfaces
