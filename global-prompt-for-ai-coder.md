    <userCommand> lifeline
      <trigger>
        When a user types <strong>lifeline</strong>, Cascade should:
      </trigger>
      <instructions>
        <step>  
          1. **Create a lifeline markdown file:**  
            - Look for a folder in the project called `_lifeline`.  
            - If that folder does not exist, create it.  
            - Inside that folder, create a file called `_lifeline-[date].md`, where [date] is the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`.  
        </step>
        <step>
          2. **Gather context to write inside the lifeline file:**  
            - You are writing a prompt for an AI coder
            - Your prompt should be in XML format and have the structure a. goal b. return format c. warnings d. code map e. context  
            - In the goal section: Summarize the current project and describe the specific task or problem we are trying to solve.
            - In the return format section: Describe the expected output format of the AI coder's response.  
            - In the warnings section: Document any potential issues or warnings that may arise during the AI coder's work. Include issues we have identified. 
            - In the code map section: Include a code map of how all the elements we are working with fit together.  
            - In the context section: Include any relevant code snippets, comments, or other information that can help the AI coder understand the project context.  
            - If applicable, **log the intended** before and after states of any planned code changes in code blocks (without applying changes to the actual codebase).  
        </step>
        <step>
          3. **Important**  
            - **Only create the lifeline file.**  
            - **Do not make any modifications to the existing codebase.**  
            - **Do not edit or modify filesâ€”just document information inside the lifeline file.**
            - **Stop working after you've created the lifeline file.**  
        </step>
