# LifeLine Project Context - February 13, 2025

## Project Overview
LifeLine is a VS Code extension that integrates with OpenAI's o1 model to provide senior-level AI assistance for coding tasks. The extension creates and manages a history of AI interactions in markdown files, making it easy to track and reference conversations.

## Current State
The project is currently at version 0.2.1 and includes:
- VS Code extension implementation
- OpenAI o1 model integration
- Automatic markdown file generation for interaction history
- Two main commands: "lifeline" and "lifeline spec"

## Project Structure
Key components:
- `/development`: Contains development-related files (10 items)
- `/docs`: Project documentation (7 items)
- `global-prompt-for-ai-coder.md`: Contains AI behavior rules
- `lifeLine-0.2.1.vsix`: The packaged extension

## Technical Notes
- The extension requires user's OpenAI API key for functionality
- Interactions are preserved as markdown files in the `_lifeline` directory
- The extension integrates with VS Code's extension API
- Commands are triggered through the AI code helper chat interface

## File References
Key project files:
- `/README.md`: Main project documentation and usage instructions
- `/global-prompt-for-ai-coder.md`: AI behavior configuration
- `/_lifeline/`: Directory containing interaction history
- `/docs/`: Project documentation directory

## Design Decisions
1. **Markdown-based History**
   - All interactions are stored as markdown files
   - Provides easy version control and readability
   - Enables simple export and sharing of interactions

2. **Command-based Interface**
   - Two distinct commands ("lifeline" and "lifeline spec")
   - Clear separation between general guidance and specification creation
   - Non-destructive operation (no automatic code modifications)

3. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Uses o1 model for high-quality responses
   - Requires user's API key for security
   - Maintains context through markdown file generation
