# Recommended Strategy for Creating and Updating Lifeline Documentation

Below is a concise plan, broken into clear steps, to seamlessly integrate lifeline logs into the project without requiring major structural changes or code modifications. This guide is written for a mid-level engineer familiar with Git, markdown, and general software practices.

---

## 1. Verify or Create the _lifeline Directory

1. Locate the project’s root directory.
2. Check for a folder named `_lifeline`.  
   - If `_lifeline` does not exist, create it at the root level of the project.  

This directory will serve as a centralized space for all future lifeline logs.

---

## 2. Create a New Lifeline File Using the Current Timestamp

1. Determine today’s date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`.
2. Inside the `_lifeline` folder, create a new file named:  
   ```
   _lifeline-[date].md
   ```
   For example:  
   ```
   _lifeline-2023-10-01-14-00-00.md
   ```
3. This file is where all project-specific documentation, context, and proposed changes will be logged.  
4. Ensure the underscore prefix (`_lifeline-[date].md`) is used to maintain consistency with the existing naming pattern.

---

## 3. Summarize the Project and Current Task

Within the newly created lifeline markdown file, include:

1. A concise overview of the project’s purpose, architecture, and any relevant background information.  
2. A detailed description of the specific problem or task at hand—highlighting scope, goals, and potential constraints.

Example snippet inside the file:
```markdown
## Project Overview
This project is designed to provide [functionality/purpose]…

## Current Task
We need to address [describe the problem] by implementing [describe the solution approach].
```

---

## 4. Document Technical Details and Design Decisions

1. Add subsections for architecture notes, technology stacks, and any design patterns used.  
2. Note any third-party libraries or frameworks that are crucial.  
3. Outline how different modules fit together.

Recommended categories within the file:
```markdown
## Technical Notes
- Technology Stack: [e.g., Node.js, React, Python, etc.]
- Core Dependencies: [List important libraries]
- Architecture Structure: [Microservices, Monolith, etc.]

## Design Decisions
- Chosen Patterns: [MVC, MVVM, etc.]
- Rationale: [Why you made certain decisions]
```

---

## 5. Reference Files, Paths, and Code Segments

Include a reference section to tie your documentation to actual code locations or relevant files. For example:
```markdown
## Reference Section
- Main Application Entry: ./src/index.js
- Configuration Files: ./config/*.js
- Database Models: ./database/models/*.js
```

This makes it easier for any team member to navigate the segments you’re referring to without modifying them directly.

---

## 6. Log Proposed Changes Using Before/After Code Blocks

If any code changes are planned, document them here in markdown code blocks. Do not implement actual changes in the repository; simply record your intentions. For example:
```markdown
## Planned Code Changes

### Before
```js
// Only for reference — do not edit actual code
function calculateTotal(items) {
    // existing logic
}
```

### After
```js
// Proposed change — not applied in codebase
function calculateTotal(items, discountRate) {
    // new logic incorporating discountRate
}
```
```

These code snippets let you and your team preview what you intend to alter without touching the actual codebase.

---

## 7. Final Checks

1. Confirm that you have only created or updated the `_lifeline-[date].md` file in the `_lifeline` folder.  
2. Ensure no other code files or configuration files are edited.  
3. Commit your lifeline file to source control (e.g., Git) as a documentation update:
   ```bash
   git add _lifeline/_lifeline-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md
   git commit -m "Add new lifeline documentation for [date and task]"
   git push
   ```

---

## Conclusion

Following these steps ensures that your project maintains a clean history of design decisions, objectives, and proposed code modifications without disrupting the existing codebase. By carefully documenting in `_lifeline-[date].md`, you preserve a clear, chronological record for future team members or stakeholders who need an in-depth understanding of the project's evolution.
