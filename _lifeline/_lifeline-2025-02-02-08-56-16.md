# Current Project State and Context

## Project Overview
This is a VS Code extension called LifeLine that provides functionality to capture and process development context through markdown files. The extension has been recently updated to:

1. Watch for new markdown files in the `_lifeline` folder
2. Process the content through OpenAI's API
3. Generate response files with expert engineering guidance

## Recent Changes
- Added FileSystemWatcher to monitor `_lifeline` folder
- Implemented automatic file processing on creation
- Updated API interaction to use file content as prompt
- Added response file generation with "-response-" naming pattern

## Current Implementation
- Extension watches for `.md` files in `_lifeline` folder
- Uses OpenAI API with a system prompt for expert engineering advice
- Creates response files automatically
- Handles errors and provides user feedback through VS Code notifications

## Questions/Concerns
1. How can we improve the robustness of the file watching system?
2. Are there any potential edge cases in the file naming pattern?
3. Should we add additional error handling or retry mechanisms?
4. Could the response format be enhanced for better readability?
